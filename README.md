Let's start with the menu, yes?

From the assignment https://learnmesome.codes/lessons/06/homework/#/4  
The menu must list the following options:
+ Create new entry
+ View existing entry
+ Delete existing entry
+ Quit Application

How about I make an array with those 4 elements, and have the method for displaying the method print it all to screen with one per line.

Let's see how that works

yeah, gotta push to have it show up on github DumbDumb

and the line breaks are for the different commits, dig?

I finally got around to changing the sublime setting for making tabs use spaces. And thankfully the next option is about tab stops, so deleting a tab works the same. God I love this editor

Bully for me, I got the menu.

Forgot that the puts array.inspect actually shows it in the brackets, and normally it prints it like I want with each element to a line. Horraaaay for the little things
