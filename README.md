Let's start with the menu, yes?

From the assignment https://learnmesome.codes/lessons/06/homework/#/4  
The menu must list the following options:
+ Create new entry
+ View existing entry
+ Delete existing entry
+ Quit Application

How about I make an array with those 4 elements, and have the method for displaying the method print it all to screen with one per line.

Let's see how that works
